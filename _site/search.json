The data dictionary is also available in Kaggle website.\nThe questions I aim to answer with this dataset is exploring the relationship between the popularity of steel roller coasters and roller coasters’ features (such as speed, height, geological location, etc.). The intended audiences for this data analysis are people who enjoy riding roller coasters or people who are curious about different factors influencing the popularity of roller coasters.\nWe use points (points given to the roller coaster) to measure the popularity of roller coaster in this data analysis. More popular roller coasters are given higher points. Below is a statistical summary of Points variable in this data set taken from Kaggle website:"

Massachusetts, North Carolina and Ohio in the US have the most popular roller coasters, while outside the US, Ontarioa in Canada and England have the most popular roller coasters. Roller coasters with floorless seating type are most popular on average in general, although several roller coasters with sit down seating type are extremely popular. There may exist positive relationship between speed of roller coasters and their popularity, but the association is not very strong and differ by roller coasters at different places."
